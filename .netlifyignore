# Ignore these files from triggering builds
# But note: we still need data.json to be served, so we can't ignore it completely
# Instead, we use an empty build command to minimize build time

# The real solution is to configure Netlify dashboard:
# Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Build Settings
# Set "Skip builds" or use commit message "[skip netlify]"
